And if you’re getting delivery…seriously, what? \n\nThe deals themselves are abysmal and there are the points that expire before you can use them unless you’re a walking heart attack waiting to happen. For a place with such absurd pricing for their bottom tier “food”, you’d think they’d at least try and incentivize you with tempting deals, but they can’t even do that. Deleted. \n\nJust more confirmation of why it’s so easy to disregard the nostalgia cravings that lead to McDonald’s. When I can get better food at better prices, why would I ever use this app or even eat this junk again unless it’s 3am and my standards and intellectual coherence are on the floor? McDonald’s is very clearly on a slow march into obscurity and irrelevance and I’m thoroughly enjoying it.

It also kinda looks like the address after i put in my apartment or suite number it disappears so they cant see it. Im nit sure if thats completely right but thats the \nhow it looks to me\n\nEdit- would be great if it was done seeing door dashers keep getting lost because they cant read delivery instructions where i give them details on where to go","category":"Location\/Geolocation","sentiment_std":"Neutral","rating":4,"review_date":"2025-12-28","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"You can’t use gift cards in the app yet.
