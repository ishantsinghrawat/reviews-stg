I am not able to dismiss the banner for about 5 seconds (close button is non responsive). The entire app experience is painful (eg. Animations freeze the app, the scrolling is laggy, the image loading is slow). Users shouldn’t have to go through so much frustration to make a simple online order. Please consider another mobile developer that could provide a better quality app.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2025-12-06","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Excelente","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Neutral","rating":5,"review_date":"2025-12-06","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Apps great for points and rewards but being asked constantly if I’m texting and driving when I’m walking is very annoying also have to close the same full screen ad multiple times","category":"Rewards\/Offers","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":3,"review_date":"2025-12-06","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"They have changed the app to where you now HAVE TO tip drivers.

The Pin could not be changed and upon contacting the driver they said it could not be delivered because it’s too far.
