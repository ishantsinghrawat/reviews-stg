So we know this is an app issue not our phones. Also, it says the code will open when we’re nearby a store, but we’re in the drive through and it doesn’t load. Is this a new “feature”? It would be nice if it was reverted the way it was before.

Doesn’t matter if I restart it , it generates the same exact code that does not work. So I miss out on more then half the points I should have so that they can later steal them back from me …  annnnnd there is no easy way to contact anyone in order to correct any issues you have with orders, points or the app. Super lazy foundation for an app to run the world’s biggest fast food chain.
