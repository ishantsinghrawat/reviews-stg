Again, The latest version is broken. When i want to change locations or do anything for that matter, I always have to do it twice, and whenever I open the app it has my last order in the checkout and i have to clear it. Also still havent added the option to customize coffee after it is selected. Instead you have to go back manually to customize your coffee. I no longer use this app to order it's just for the code and then I order at the drive thru.","cluster":"app scam, reward app, fix app","review_date":"2025-09-01","rating":1},{"x":-1.1152780056,"y":2.1676104069,"z":3.9656395912,"phrase":"kids","review":"I give it to my kids","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-09-01","rating":5},{"x":-6.1364779472,"y":0.5467147231,"z":6.674472332,"phrase":"lost mcd account","review":"continually locked out of my account, can't sign in using password. must use email and email wasn't working so lost my whole mcd account and all my points. what a terrible app and a crocked company for stealing accounts.","cluster":"app scam, reward app, fix app","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":-6.117415905,"y":0.2567566633,"z":6.8223567009,"phrase":"locked account","review":"continually locked out of my account, can't sign in using password. must use email and email wasn't working so lost my whole mcd account and all my points. what a terrible app and a crocked company for stealing accounts.","cluster":"app scam, reward app, fix app","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":-6.1097240448,"y":0.26661098,"z":6.8043103218,"phrase":"continually locked account","review":"continually locked out of my account, can't sign in using password. must use email and email wasn't working so lost my whole mcd account and all my points. what a terrible app and a crocked company for stealing accounts.","cluster":"app scam, reward app, fix app","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":-0.8783013821,"y":4.1664037704,"z":5.2490310669,"phrase":"mcdonals walmart joke","review":"that is can't order from a real mcdonals because it's 300 meter father then then half a mcdonals in the walmart what a joke","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":-0.9216379523,"y":4.2612862587,"z":5.3574905396,"phrase":"order real mcdonals","review":"that is can't order from a real mcdonals because it's 300 meter father then then half a mcdonals in the walmart what a joke","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":-0.9079534411,"y":4.2914433479,"z":5.368326664,"phrase":"real mcdonals 300","review":"that is can't order from a real mcdonals because it's 300 meter father then then half a mcdonals in the walmart what a joke","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":0.484739542,"y":3.1581597328,"z":4.5979089737,"phrase":"uber eats walk","review":"Its not good its bad I hate this app don't get it there's uber eats and u can walk or drive so ya....","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":0.4251730442,"y":3.1938221455,"z":4.5483751297,"phrase":"uber eats","review":"Its not good its bad I hate this app don't get it there's uber eats and u can walk or drive so ya....","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":0.4445095658,"y":3.2205007076,"z":4.5369038582,"phrase":"theres uber eats","review":"Its not good its bad I hate this app don't get it there's uber eats and u can walk or drive so ya....","cluster":"mcdonald rewards, mcdonald app, sucks mcdonald","review_date":"2025-08-31","rating":1},{"x":-5.0967140198,"y":-1.3489121199,"z":4.4255356789,"phrase":"app randomly work","review":"the app randomly work. every few visits to mcdinalds they tell me the code doesnt work.
