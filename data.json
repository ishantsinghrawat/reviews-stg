Scrolling is barely working and very laggy. Switching pages takes more than 5 seconds to just show up (and more to load all elements). McDonald, you have money for proper software devs and QA. Shame on you for having such a sluggish and frustrating app in production.\n\nOh and cherry on top of that: advertising their own products is not enough. They now push ads from other companies like Expedia.\n\nI will be uninstalling and just ordering in restaurants.","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2025-12-10","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Code never loads on either my phone or my partner’s.
