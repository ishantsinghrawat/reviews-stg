Trying to place an order is a confused mess and you cannot even search for specific menu items. Trying to order offered items does not work and it ends up in a cycle of trying to show items that you don’t want. ordering from services like DoorDash is far far easier.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-09","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"This stupid app works half the time I use it, and the other half I have to screw around with it just for it to take payment and actually put the order through.","category":"Payments","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-08","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"App needs to scale up their instances in cloud.

I love the ease of ordering food. But wear this app falls short is it crashes often, it always has a weak signal it states even if you’re on Wi-Fi it’s often very slow glitchy. you cannot put gift cards on there like Tim Hortons or Starbucks allows you to there’s no scan and pay option with a gift card. It’s decent for the points, but it’s poor almost everywhere else needs to be really revamped and updated.","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2026-01-07","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Whomever had the idea to create this app versus the paper coupons should be flogged and fired.  You can’t import coupons, the item descriptions are garbage, and the deals crash.  I barely eat at McDonalds now because the prices are outrageous, the offers in the app NEVER work, and you barely get any different choices if you manage to get paper coupons.  A greedy corporation that we should all avoid until they start acting more like humans, and less like evil money hungry corporate drones.  Very sad what this franchise has become.","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-07","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"App never works when near a McDonald’s or even at home.
