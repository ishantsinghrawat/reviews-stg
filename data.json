There is a code for points collection, them to redeem points you have to redeem a specific code for a specific promo. There’s tons of different codes for different items.\n\nHow hard is it to just scan a barcode at the window when you pay and either collect points or redeem them for rewards at the point of purchase?\n\nPretty much every retail and fast food establishment uses their app this way except McDonald’s.\n\nIt’s way too unnecessarily complicated for simple transactions.","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-09-29","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"Menu items won’t load.

The McDonald’s app used to be fast and convenient — now it’s an ad farm that makes me wait through full-screen promo takeovers before I can do literally anything. I downloaded this app for speed and a smooth customer experience; instead I get shoved through marketing after marketing until I give up. If your “improved experience” is blocking customers from ordering, congratulations: mission accomplished — you’ve turned convenience into clutter. I’m uninstalling and won’t recommend this to anyone until there’s an option to skip promos or turn them off.
