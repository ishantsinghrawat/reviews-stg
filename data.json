And if you’re getting delivery…seriously, what’s wrong with you? What kind of self loathing degenerate orders McDonald’s delivery lol. Sad! The deals themselves are abysmal and there are the points that expire before you can use them unless you’re a zit covered 300 pound walking heart attack waiting to happen. For a place with such absurd pricing for their bottom tier “food”, you’d think they’d at least try and incentivize you with tempting deals, but they can’t even do that. Deleted. Just more confirmation of why it’s so easy to disregard the nostalgia cravings that lead to McDonald’s. When I can get better food at better prices, why would I ever use this app or even eat this junk again unless it’s 3am and my standards and intellectual coherence are on the floor? McDonald’s is very clearly on a slow march into obscurity and irrelevance and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. Reap what you sow and all that.\n\nIn summary, this app represents McDonald’s perfectly, bottom tier app for bottom tier fast food for the bottom tier of humanity.","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-11","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.84.2"},{"review":"Thank tou for givejng mcdonalds","category":"Rewards\/Offers","sentiment_std":"Positive","rating":5,"review_date":"2025-11-11","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.84.2"},{"review":"Awesome","category":"Rewards\/Offers","sentiment_std":"Positive","rating":5,"review_date":"2025-11-10","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.84.2"},{"review":"Smooth that app detects my arrival without checking in.
