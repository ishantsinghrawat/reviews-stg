Second when you want to use one of the discounts or deals or whatnot the app will give you several but it’s trapped behind either a delivery only or in the restaurant only step. You’re in the parking lot looking at deals and you see a $2 McDouble, awesome but then you realize you have to have it delivered somewhere… it ruins the mood. Third, they changed it so that every time you bring up a code for collecting points or redeeming, if your phone turns off it will give you a new code when you turn your phone back on, not all that bad but it is annoying when you were familiar with something so long. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where it’s easier to just wait for coupons in the mail, and honestly the couple will likely end up being a better deal then whatever you can get in the app anyway. I had to delete it for peace of mind because collecting the points just wasn’t worth it to me anymore, but if you have the patience to deal with a janky app that lags and takes it’s sweet time loading the next screen if it means getting a free McDouble after spending $60 it might be the app for you.","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-30","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review_id":null,"user_name":"bronwynm15","review_title":"Glitchy app with terrible support","review":"This app will stop working every once in a while <3 won’t accept completely valid payments for no reason.

For a place with such absurd pricing for their bottom tier “food”, you’d think they’d at least try and incentivize you with tempting deals, but they can’t even do that. Deleted. \n\nJust more confirmation of why it’s so easy to disregard the nostalgia cravings that lead to McDonald’s. When I can get better food at better prices, why would I ever use this app or even eat this junk again unless it’s 3am and my standards and intellectual coherence are on the floor? McDonald’s is very clearly on a slow march into obscurity and irrelevance and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. Reap what you sow and all that.\n\nIn summary, this app represents McDonald’s perfectly, bottom tier app for bottom tier fast food for the bottom tier of humanity.","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-14","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review_id":null,"user_name":"dreww1122","review_title":"Pointless mobile order","review":"Don’t waste your time doing a mobile order for something that needs to be made fresh.
