[{"review":"Stop pre selecting the pickup type for me when checking out.And why is the pickup options now small, on top of the screen in the same page as the payment? Why the change for this crucial step? I end up paying not realizing it selects drive thru when I am not going in the drive thru but inside. This creates confusion at the cashier when trying to pickup and a waste of my time. Sometime I do drive thru sometimes not.
