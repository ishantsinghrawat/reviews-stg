Other times, it will direct you to the most overpriced franchisee that you avoid like the plague. No control over where your delivery is coming from can be a huge problem. \nNext, their payment system seems to work as frequently as the ice cream machines in the US. I end up not being able to pay through their app. If I’m at a location, that’s a minor inconvenience if I’m in store or doing drive through, but makes the other options like curbside or table service untenable. \nLastly getting support for order issues isn’t straight forward. For example, when the store forgets to include or sends the wrong items, you have to go through a couple pages to get to the phone number that you call to get the refund through door dash.  They don’t seem to want to support their own platform and offload things so they have the option to claim ignorance when things go wrong. \nOverall, the app is plagued with an inordinate amount of minor issues that create problems with many aspects of ordering. As a points and rewards app it’s ok, but the clunky performance make that frustrating as well. I’ll continue to use it, but know it also serves as a strong suggestion to patronize other businesses when I’m trying to patronize McDonalds.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2026-02-08","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Super easy to order with","category":"Payments","sentiment_std":"Positive","rating":5,"review_date":"2026-02-08","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Tu m’as donné 44 cartes mais mon frère à eu 49 cartes","category":"Payments","sentiment_std":"Neutral","rating":3,"review_date":"2026-02-07","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"The app is amazing for getting points and offers but it can be very slow idk if that’s a issue for anyone else but when i open the app it takes forever to close the pop up ad and get my code, it was annoying enough for me to make this review!","category":"Rewards\/Offers","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":3,"review_date":"2026-02-07","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Puts me in a boot loop","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-02-07","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Great app but very slow","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":4,"review_date":"2026-02-07","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"Always signs me out which is annoying but this time I’ve been trying to log in for 4 days with no success.

I’ve had many instances where I’m at the drive thru, and even trying to load the app before I even get into the lane, it’ll still be loading you into the scanning code section. Seriously, when the app starts, it does its normal initial loading prompt, then it says “Do not text and drive” which is something you try to click “OK” to but a bunch of other text and drive prompts show up. Kn top of that, they make you wait for their flipping offer you have to constantly click “No thanks” to which is also very slow because everything is loading at once. From opening the app to finally being able to scan your code sometimes can take about half a minute.

If you are patient it might be for you but I’ve lost my patience. First off the app has started to run considerably slow and lags often. Second when you want to use one of the discounts or deals or whatnot the app will give you several but it’s trapped behind either a delivery only or in the restaurant only step. You’re in the parking lot looking at deals and you see a $2 McDouble, awesome but then you realize you have to have it delivered somewhere… it ruins the mood. Third, they changed it so that every time you bring up a code for collecting points or redeeming, if your phone turns off it will give you a new code when you turn your phone back on, not all that bad but it is annoying when you were familiar with something so long. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where it’s easier to just wait for coupons in the mail, and honestly the couple will likely end up being a better deal then whatever you can get in the app anyway. I had to delete it for peace of mind because collecting the points just wasn’t worth it to me anymore, but if you have the patience to deal with a janky app that lags and takes it’s sweet time loading the next screen if it means getting a free McDouble after spending $60 it might be the app for you.","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-30","source":"App Store","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"App would be good if it would stop logging me out each week!!
