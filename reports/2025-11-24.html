<td>Delivery</td>
<td>App isn't usable anymore for Delivery. switches the last digit of my address from a 9 to a 0 when I put the order in, delivering my meal to a house about 6km away from my own consistently. Has happened 3 times now, entering my correct address every time. Definitely a bug with the Doordash integration because it also happened with the Subway app that uses the same system.</td>

<td>UI/UX</td>
<td>poor user exp. Never understand why orders need to be placed so close to the store. I’m using Online cuz of the distance to the store. If you want to maintain your “freshly made” standard, you could add an “order time” feature instead. Also, after update, the app keeps asking for my store location again and again. What’s Mc standard for hiring UX designers? Have they ever used the app to place an order? Apps for restaurants like this should be standardized, do more research pls, that's expected</td>
