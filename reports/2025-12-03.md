| Authentication/Login | You have to be sent an email to sign in, then sent to your browser for the link, and then the link doesn't work. So this is app isn't for actual use. | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-02 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | app is apparently glitchy, according to the manager. it charged my card, she told us it was just a pending and would fall off. as the store had not received payment, then made my husband pay again. told us to "come back tomorrow" if it wasnt resolved, and that the app doesn't this a lot when the system times out. | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-02 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | might be the worst app I've ever used for having bugs and issues. | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-02 | Google Play |
