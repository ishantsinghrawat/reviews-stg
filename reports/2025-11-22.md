| Rewards/Offers | Can no longer change my pickup option at the restaraunt. Picked the wrong one and there was no option but to cancel my whole order and lose all of my offers. So I just left.... | 25.111.0 | 2025-11-21 | Google Play |
| Authentication/Login | Pure garbage. Can't log back into the account. It never sends an email. | 25.84.0 | 2025-11-21 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | the app routinely messes up. thankfully, the service center is good. really good. but the app messes up way too much. I end up using uber and getting something else quite often. | 25.111.0 | 2025-11-21 | Google Play |
