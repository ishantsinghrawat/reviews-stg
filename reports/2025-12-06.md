### Negative Review Details (today)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |

| Rewards/Offers | this app is brutal. I hate the fact that you can earn rewards and if you don't use them after a period of time, they take your points away. not a good way to keep your customers. I would rather go to Chick-fil-A cuz the food is better there than to eat at McDonald's. not a good way to keep customers | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-05 | Google Play |
| UI/UX | terrible app they constantly make worse. points are worth 1/4 of what they used to be. the app asks you to select which mcdonalds you want to order from in between every item you pick, despite me being in the parking lot. they have pop up ads for certain items, and if you click add, it doesnt even work. | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-05 | Google Play |
| UI/UX | I always mobile order, sometimes it's a little spotty, the monopoly was a disaster but right now I'm most annoyed at the update over mobile ordering!! stop changing things in the app! we want to set it and have it ready for us but the app keeps resetting the pickup option to counter when I ALWAYS go through drive thru and then you can't change it and can't cancel since "they're already making the order". change it back to the way it was! what a pain. | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-05 | Google Play |
| Rewards/Offers | not very happy when I had enough points to offer a double quarter pounder with chese . when I order it said it was free get to the window I had to pay . done it 3 times thinkbim done with the app n when u look at the app says it was canceled. think I just order instead use it . | 25.111.0 | 2025-12-05 | Google Play |
