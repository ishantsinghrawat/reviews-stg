### Authentication/Login — new negative samples
- Logs out, then has no way to login with a password. Forces to login with email and then never sends any email. It is impossible to login and use this app.

### Delivery — new negative samples
- worst experience
- App won't let me order because it says I have a pending order.. from a delivery THREE days ago. How long before it clears the app? This needs an update soon to remove this barrier. I should be able to order over and over if I want to.
