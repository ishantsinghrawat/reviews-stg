### Crashes/Bugs — new negative samples
- Its really bad. It won't load codes, and when it does they're wrong. A refresh just leads to an error. fix this garbage.
- what a terrible app. Kept changing the location to the closest one even when we changed it to where we are going. When we arrived the manager told me the order was canceled and to pay twice. Once we double checked the app there was an option to reorder what we had payed for. The staff are clearing the orders to up the traceables so they look better while I wait.

### Payments — new negative samples
- for the better than tim hortons taste and price coffee, your staff can never make it right the first time, and since anytime I go in its on my limited breaks I don't have 20 minutes to make sure theyre doing something right that should take 5 minutes.
