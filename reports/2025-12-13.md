### Delivery — new negative samples
- App used to be better. I hate that you have to pick drive thru, etc now before you even get there. Pulled in to discover the drive thru blocked by their delivery truck. cancelled the order and left because there's no way to change the method after.

### Payments — new negative samples
- update as of dec/12/25 not interested in Expedia points so I guess I order from somewhere.

### Rewards/Offers — new negative samples
- Never works when I need it to. Freezes when I get to the drive-through and code doesn't work. Can't get large or Xtra large coffee with points anymore. They trying to loose customers? Tim's still let's you get any size hot beverages...
