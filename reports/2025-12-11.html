<td>Is it just me, or does this completely nonsensical app constantly require large updates every month or so (like inconveniently near a gig of reserved space required) only to feel like nothing was changed afterwards! Still sticky &amp; slow as ever, still got issues upon points redemption and still just ultimately useless❕️ McDonald's should seriously consider just allowing users to access their rewards accounts through their website instead of making their awful app downloads &amp; usage mandatory.</td>
