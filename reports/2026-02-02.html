<td>Delivery</td>
<td>Mobile orders always get rejected when ordering Mcdelivery. Also when using McDelivery you don't get to choose the restaurant it is coming from. I've been trying to order McDelivery for the past 3 months and the order always fails. It's frusterating trying to order food for multiple people just for the order to be rejected. Please fix this. I havent had any issues with mobile delivery orders from other fast food chains.</td>
