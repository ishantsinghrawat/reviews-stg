### Negative Review Details (today)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payments | Current version of the app is BROKEN. Place an order from home, pay, drive to the closest McD's, and as soon as I pull into the lot, the DAMN thing picks that I want TABLE SERVICE. Does not let you choose, just auto-picks table service. I wanted to use the drive thru or mobile pickup. Can't change it, can't order again because I already have an order in. FIX IT! FIX IT! FIX IT! It is BROKEN. | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-16 | Google Play |
| Feature Requests | Made the upselling feature unavoidable, unacceptable practice. | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-16 | Google Play |
| Rewards/Offers | it's very difficult to find anything | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-16 | Google Play |
| Rewards/Offers | You can't store up points. They just take them if you dont spend them in time which means you have to go a ridiculous amount to ever actually get something. Also, McDonald's burgers are so small now what's even the point? | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-16 | Google Play |
