### Authentication/Login — new negative samples
- It keeps logging me out. When to go sign in, it no longer asks for password but for email to send a link. Which I rarely get. Sent a form and got a response regarding nothing to what I was complaining…
- With the latest update it keeps logging you out and you are not able to log in with password. You have to wait for a email they send to you to log in which takes forever to come. Fix this
- App is useless without logging in and it doesn't let you log in. Tells the user to enter an email then "sends" an email so they can log in without a password. Problem is it just never sends the email …
- can't log in anymore. refuses to send a verification code to my email. what a fantastic update fail
- Terrible sign in system. App makes you verify your email but doesnt send the email for over an hour. How am I supposed to log in to place an order if I have to wait over an hour for a verification ema…

### Crashes/Bugs — new negative samples

- The app. is not able to place any orders, even after i've reinstalled the app twice now. If there were an option to give it a zero, i would've done so by now. I'm not gonna go in too much detail, but …

### Performance/Speed — new negative samples
- very slow, can't add monopoly codes. fine when it works properly, but rarely does.
- used to be able to have your store saved, now it's so slow and keeps asking the same questions before putting in an order. why can't it save, and remember what my preferred store is
- you'd think this software is flying to Mars with all the thinking it has to do! not responsive!
- The "mobile order" is an absolute joke. How does starting the order when you arrive, be considered mobile order? I might as well have just ordered in person at that point.
- This app is slow, cumbersome, and unintuitive. Recently it has been failing to load codes for my orders. It is aggravating.

### Rewards/Offers — new negative samples
- Deals are not actually deals at all... The Monopoly Games are rigged as it was made very clear in documentaries. All in all, there is no point in going when it's no longer quick and affordable. Their …
- Zero option to use Monopoly in the middle of promo! Cleary many issues, hopefully resolved soon
- if you ever log out you'll never get back in. the rewards dont work either when you try to redeem. total scam
- I'm not able to enter my Monopoly codes to the app.
- the McDonald's app 85% of the time doesnt allow you to select the monopoly redeem code.

### UI/UX — new negative samples
- I won on the monopoly pieces and I can't claim my prizes on the app. I can't click on it, nothing opens up 🤨
- Not user-friendly at all, it is especially infuriating to look at the nutrition information. Once you click on an item to see the nutritional information, it takes you back to the main menu, not back …
- Can't click on anything monopoly related to enter codes etc.. Keep advertising mcdonalds but the play now and enter codes buttons do nothing inside the app. Everything else works fine. Most updated ve…
- Monopoly link on app since update won't work (worked fine last year)
- Ever time I open the app it doubles the pop-ups. So I have to close 2x things anytime. On top of that it’s not responsive when I do so. Navigating the app itself is also frustrating. Again, glitchy, l…
