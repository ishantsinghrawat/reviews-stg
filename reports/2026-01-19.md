### Negative Review Details (today)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |

| UI/UX | This is one of the worst apps I've ever had the displeasure of using. The UI is extremely slow, laggy, and will still charge my credit card after repeated attempts to order with error messages or declaring I'm at the wrong location (when I'm not). No option to dispute a charge. Do not recommend. | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-18 | Google Play |
