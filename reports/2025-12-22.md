### Crashes/Bugs — new negative samples
- app always glitches. takes forever to load or doesn't load at all. doesn't pick up my location when I'm there and more recently I switched phones and can't sign in because it wants you to sign up and log in at the same place and just keeps telling me an account already exists with that email. would love the app if it actually worked.
