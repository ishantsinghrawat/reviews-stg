<td>Edit: one problem solved two problems added. app kept telling me my credit card was expired but would still let me pay with it after reselecting it. so eventually I relieved the card and added the new one and now I just get a message telling me sorry we can't process your order right now. tried another card. uninstalling. no difference.</td>

<td>UI/UX</td>
<td>Great ordering experience. The only flaw I find is its very hard to tell when reward points expire. I'm not sure if that's McDonald's goal so they save $? I wish you had the option to look at the history if you choose to but otherwise a summary would be so much easier to see. So many points expire for me because I don't go check when they do, it's a lot of scrolling...</td>

<td>Buggiest software I've ever used. Sheer incompetence from every developer that ever touched this app's codebase.</td>
