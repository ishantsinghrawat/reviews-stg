### Crashes/Bugs — new negative samples
- cannot open.awful app

### Performance/Speed — new negative samples
- waited 10 mins before leaving my place before my order. arrived to be told it will take 10 mins. so does that mean it takes 20 mins for an online order! the order was only 25.00 worth of food why it take so long?
- App is incredibly slow.

### UI/UX — new negative samples
- You seriously need to do some major IT work on your app. It essentially does nothing but show you the menu. You can't order, doesn't matter if you change location, method pickup, menu items, use offers or go straight from the ordering menu. It literally does nothing but sit there with the little stupid fry icon for eternity. Completely useless.
