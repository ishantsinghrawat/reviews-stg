### Negative Review Details (today)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payments | Edit: one problem solved two problems added. app kept telling me my credit card was expired but would still let me pay with it after reselecting it. so eventually I relieved the card and added the new one and now I just get a message telling me sorry we can't process your order right now. tried another card. uninstalling. no difference. | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-09 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | Not working at All | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-09 | Google Play |
| UI/UX | Great ordering experience. The only flaw I find is its very hard to tell when reward points expire. I'm not sure if that's McDonald's goal so they save $? I wish you had the option to look at the history if you choose to but otherwise a summary would be so much easier to see. So many points expire for me because I don't go check when they do, it's a lot of scrolling... | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-09 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | the app keeps cutting out and now it won't work. | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-09 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | Buggiest software I've ever used. Sheer incompetence from every developer that ever touched this app's codebase. | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-09 | Google Play |
