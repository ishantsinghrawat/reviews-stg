### Payments — new negative samples
- A value meal double cheeseburger is priced at $6.99 now. Don't bother installing the app. This is dog food priced higher than gold.

### UI/UX — new negative samples
- Is it just me, or does this completely nonsensical app constantly require large updates every month or so (like inconveniently near a gig of reserved space required) only to feel like nothing was changed afterwards! Still sticky & slow as ever, still got issues upon points redemption and still just ultimately useless❕️ McDonald's should seriously consider just allowing users to access their rewards accounts through their website instead of making their awful app downloads & usage mandatory.
- truly, a useless app. I can't even order. to add to the mix, when I CAN order, they attempt to force a tip by refusing to let the screen load of you try to custom tip.
