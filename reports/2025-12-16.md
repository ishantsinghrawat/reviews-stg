### Delivery — new negative samples
- don't use McDelivery! I ordered 2 upgraded meals - i redeemed 14000 points for 1 meal and spent $30 on the other meal with delivery and a tip. the order i received was worth $10 or so - a bagel and a couple drinks. I contacted customer service who verified by order numbers on the receipt. Yet will not refund my money or deliver the food I ordered. the supervisor called me back at 11pm - 7 hours after I originally called the customer service line. complete rip off. Will never order off app again!
