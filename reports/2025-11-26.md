### Negative Review Details (today)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crashes/Bugs | This app is completely useless. It won't let me add items to my order, I just get bouncing french fries that never end. I closed the app and went to Wendy's instead. | 25.111.0 | 2025-11-25 | Google Play |
| Payments | would give a lot better score if my points didn't dissappear... I don't care if theyre not used for 20 years they're my points I paid for.. you guys owe me 40,000 points. | 25.111.0 | 2025-11-25 | Google Play |
| Refunds | got cold food again | 25.111.0 | 2025-11-25 | Google Play |
