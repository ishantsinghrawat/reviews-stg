| Crashes/Bugs | buggy app needs rework | 25.111.0 | 2026-02-04 | Google Play |
| Crashes/Bugs | Was working fine for me for years until a few days ago, now won't give option to go through drivethrough or curbside pickup, instead jumps straight to counter service. Been caught twice in the drivethrough with my car with the wrong code. 1st time I thought it was something I skipped but then it happened again. This needs to be fixed! | 9.80.0 | 2026-02-04 | Google Play |
