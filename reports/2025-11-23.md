### Rewards/Offers — new negative samples
- going to McDonald's less now that rewards are not worth it, no incentive for me to use that app and go in-store. Why destroy a good service for penny pinching on rewards, I don't go to McDonald's anymore now. doordash can't deliveries right either.

### UI/UX — new negative samples
- App is terrible. Navigation is not smooth and loading is awful. My family ordered tonight and our meal was wrong. When I tried contact support in the app, that section wouldn't load.
