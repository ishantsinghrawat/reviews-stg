### Delivery — new negative samples
- App isn't usable anymore for Delivery. switches the last digit of my address from a 9 to a 0 when I put the order in, delivering my meal to a house about 6km away from my own consistently. Has happened 3 times now, entering my correct address every time. Definitely a bug with the Doordash integration because it also happened with the Subway app that uses the same system.
