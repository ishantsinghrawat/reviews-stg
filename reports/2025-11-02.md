### Negative Review Details (latest run)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crashes/Bugs | this app never works when I want it to. I have those stupid monopoly stamps but the Play button on the app doesn't respond | 25.84.0 | 2025-11-01 | Google Play |
| UI/UX | Monopoly link on home screen is missing half the time like right now. Points don't apply half the time. App doesn't work to order in store sometimes. | 25.84.0 | 2025-11-01 | Google Play |

| Crashes/Bugs | Worse than before. ALL of a sudden, app gets stuck on your order confirmation and you can't even enter your monopoly codes on the same day! | 25.84.0 | 2025-11-01 | Google Play |
