### Negative Review Details (today)

| UI/UX | one of the worst apps across fast food restaurants. 2 orders placed at the same time for the same item from the same restaurant, while sitting next to each other, one price is 25cents more than the other. it is not a big deal but why? is this part of dynamic pricing and "personalised" pricing. the irony is the order from iPhone is cheaper than the Android ( pixel ). and so buggy i still can't get the Google wallet added as a payment method even though the play store listing description says so. | Unknown | 2026-02-19 | Google Play |
