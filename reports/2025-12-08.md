| Performance/Speed | The app can't tell the difference between two locations if their to close. will give you a code for a different location. it then will not give you a new code unless you restart your phone. this has slowed down the drive through because customers are having to restart their phones to place an order. | Unknown | 2025-12-07 | Google Play |
