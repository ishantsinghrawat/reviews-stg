### Negative Review Details (today)

| Category | Review | App Version | Date | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Performance/Speed | there's a few bugs when ordering and the app is slow but it works | 9.14.1 | 2026-02-01 | Google Play |
| Delivery | Mobile orders always get rejected when ordering Mcdelivery. Also when using McDelivery you don't get to choose the restaurant it is coming from. I've been trying to order McDelivery for the past 3 months and the order always fails. It's frusterating trying to order food for multiple people just for the order to be rejected. Please fix this. I havent had any issues with mobile delivery orders from other fast food chains. | 25.111.0 | 2026-02-01 | Google Play |
| Payments | can't finish order when paying VERY SLOW waited almost half an hour and still won't finish order. | 25.111.0 | 2026-02-01 | Google Play |
