<td>McDonald's price increase along with smaller portions and feeling full, not satisfied, but feeling full from the fries and not the burger is very disappointing after many decades of corporate growth and development. I do not add extra items to the combo because all the prices are too high. This reduction of my meal and raising prices has too many significant negative changes that i can see, taste and feel. Now I go to small burger places for enjoyment and satisfaction. No franchises.</td>

<td>Garbage app that never works properly. It's so bad I can't even use the rewards tab. Update: the app is still awful, kicked me out of a chat with a representative, couldn't even load the page back up, gives me an error. You guys owe me part of my order which went unfulfilled, this is fraud.</td>
