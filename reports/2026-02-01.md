| Location/Geolocation | updating my review. unfortunately McDonald's app has gotten worse. not better so it will remain at one start but they now use geolocation before the store you place your order at. can even see the order. because of this my mother who is unable to leave the house placed an order and I went to go pick it up. since her phone was at home, the store was unable to see the order. therefore they were unable to make the order. thankfully a nice manager was able to reprocess the order manually and get it | 25.111.0 | 2026-01-31 | Google Play |
