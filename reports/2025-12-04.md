### Authentication/Login — new negative samples
- the app doesn't work. can't sign in due to not being able to enter my password and your "register a new device" link being shite. Sat there several times over the last year just simply trying to login with no success. fix your app or let us use our passwords again.

### Delivery — new negative samples
- I don't need you to tell me not to text and drive every time I open the app. I want a deal on a egg mcmuffin not unsolicited advice lol

### Performance/Speed — new negative samples
- sooooo painfully slow....gets stuck & freezes....could be thru the line and eating by the time the order screen quits with the "circle of doom" thing.
