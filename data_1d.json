McD's wipes their hands of all responsibility! I thought it was a glitch in the app, so I kept trying to resend it... I was under 30min until closing time, and my order was rejected! I live 10min away! Kept resending it & they charged me without getting my order! McD's says to contact DoorDash, who says to contact my bank, and the bank screws you cause why should they get involved & I'm out almost $60 because of this!👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-08","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"}]
