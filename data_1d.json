You can't order, doesn't matter if you change location, method pickup, menu items, use offers or go straight from the ordering menu. It literally does nothing but sit there with the little stupid fry icon for eternity. Completely useless.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-12","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"}]
