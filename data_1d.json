It did not show up in the store, I asked the cashier and eventually the app canceled the order. Huge headache with ordering, I am very skeptical about using this app anymore after this being the 2nd time I had this experience. Now I have to wait to be refunded because the app didn't work properly.","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2026-01-14","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"2026 update - app sucks harder now 2023 - So much wrong with this app! First, no way to contact support through app. If the order is incorrect your SOL Second, constantly stuck on the pickup screen. It's even days and \"home\" is still stuck on my order pickup. Can't enter any Monopoly double plays because of this. Third, everytime I go to place an order I have to remove my last order from the cart.
