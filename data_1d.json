Changed the payment option & now you pay before you get there. The app will choose drive thru when I get close to the restaurant even though I am going inside. Employees can not take drive thru codes inside \"apparently\". There's now no option to change pick up anymore. You have to cancel, all promotions and\/or points are refunded within a couple of days and the promotion is unavail which means you can no longer repeat and place the same order. App crashes.","category":"Payments","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-15","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"App won't let me order because it says I have a pending order.. from a delivery THREE days ago. How long before it clears the app? This needs an update soon to remove this barrier. I should be able to order over and over if I want to.","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-15","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"}]
