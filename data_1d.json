[{"review":"This app is becoming very problematic... Don't understand what the problem seems to be?? Long load times, lags, freezes, crashes... all I want to do is order some food, and it's problematic. Fees are getting higher and higher; every time they fix a UX issue, a price increase is snuck in somewhere... the fact that the \"value meal\" can cost upward of $15 on the app, while being under $10 in the store feels like a good way to punish those who have no means to get there themselves...","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-05","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"}]
