Place an order from home, pay, drive to the closest McD's, and as soon as I pull into the lot, the DAMN thing picks that I want TABLE SERVICE. Does not let you choose, just auto-picks table service. I wanted to use the drive thru or mobile pickup. Can't change it, can't order again because I already have an order in. FIX IT! FIX IT! FIX IT!
