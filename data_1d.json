Try this; Go to McDonald's website, and subscribe to their newsletter. Once done, go back to the app and send the email...AGAIN. I hadn't been able to get into my app, for over a year. I figured was worth a shot to go to the website. This process worked for me, today. I saw many reviews with issues I was having, so I figured I'd share, and hope it wasn't a fluke!
