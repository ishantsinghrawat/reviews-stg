[{"review":"Every time I press it takes a few seconds for the app to react. Feels like 1999 at the internet cafe all over again. Monopoly is broken, such a SCAM! Every time I press \"play now\" I get the monopoly guy and flashing maple leaves and it stays stuck like that forever.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-10-30","source":"Google Play","app_version":null},{"review":"Why change something when it's working good? The last update look's like it doesn't know where to go when you it next button. the last order stay on the home screen for ever and it's like I can ever start a new order, always want me to see my receipt. It doesn't have a place to go directly to monopoly because of that.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-10-30","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"Slow and laggy","category":"Performance\/Speed","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2025-10-30","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"okay. it's monopoly time and I can't access the board. the app closes the first time I open it too. it would be nice if they kept the deals with the points and the freebies separate, or at least clean up the app a bit so they could be more easily actioned... legit takes more time to plan what you want than I want to spend... especially in the drive thru. do better McDonald's, do better.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":3,"review_date":"2025-10-30","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"Monopoly Double Play CRASHES EVERYTIME you try to add a code!!!!
