[{"review":"don't use McDelivery! I ordered 2 upgraded meals - i redeemed 14000 points for 1 meal and spent $30 on the other meal with delivery and a tip. the order i received was worth $10 or so - a bagel and a couple drinks. I contacted customer service who verified by order numbers on the receipt. Yet will not refund my money or deliver the food I ordered. the supervisor called me back at 11pm - 7 hours after I originally called the customer service line. complete rip off. Will never order off app again!","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-12-15","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"I'll be standing in a restaurant to get the app code and it asks me what location I want to order from... even when I open the app and the location is correct it asks me to confirm twice more. I'm fairly certain I know where I am at any given moment, thank you...","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Neutral","rating":2,"review_date":"2025-12-15","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"}]
