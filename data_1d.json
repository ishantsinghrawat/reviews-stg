Every single person in the drive-through is on their phone. 2-logs me out or requires an update every other time i go to use it. 3-points expire long before i get enough to redeem for anything i want.","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-29","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"Useless stupid app. Half the time it sits there hung, and then they won't accept the offers at the drive through, claiming its been used already. Which is impossible since I'm sitting in the drive through fighting with the app. How is this app so terrible with the resources McDonald's has available to them? It's not worth the tracking they want around location etc. Uninstalled.","category":"Rewards\/Offers","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-11-29","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"}]
