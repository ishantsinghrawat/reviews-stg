Also when using McDelivery you don't get to choose the restaurant it is coming from. I've been trying to order McDelivery for the past 3 months and the order always fails. It's frusterating trying to order food for multiple people just for the order to be rejected. Please fix this. I havent had any issues with mobile delivery orders from other fast food chains.","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-02-01","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"can't finish order when paying VERY SLOW waited almost half an hour and still won't finish order.","category":"Payments","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-02-01","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"}]
