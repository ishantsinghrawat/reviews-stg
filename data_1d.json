[{"review":"This App is Terrible. The app constantly gets stuck buffering forever. Half the time it doesn't recognize that I've selected something, and it constantly crashes. Takes me 30 minutes of closing, opening, and re-downloading the app to place one damn order. Terrible experience.","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-12-27","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"}]
