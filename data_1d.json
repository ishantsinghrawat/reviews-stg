I only received my coffee and my muffin. Yet I still paid for the full meal, and when I go to try and report the issue, the page never works. I'm really frustrated because this has happened multiple times. After ordering something they'll go like \"out of stock\" in the app AFTER my thing was delivered and they let me order it.","category":"Payments","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":3,"review_date":"2025-11-18","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"}]
