[{"review":"Is it just me, or does this completely nonsensical app constantly require large updates every month or so (like inconveniently near a gig of reserved space required) only to feel like nothing was changed afterwards! Still sticky & slow as ever, still got issues upon points redemption and still just ultimately useless❕️ McDonald's should seriously consider just allowing users to access their rewards accounts through their website instead of making their awful app downloads & usage mandatory.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":2,"review_date":"2025-12-10","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"},{"review":"A value meal double cheeseburger is priced at $6.99 now.
