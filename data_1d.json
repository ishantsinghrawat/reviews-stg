I have to sign out, clear cache, sign back in, and that's stupid. stop \"fixing\" what ain't broke. Last year's UI was perfect, with multiple ways to access Monopoly, multiple ways to access the draw prize page. Terrible decisions are making the app more terrible than the restaurant service.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-10-29","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.84.0"}]
