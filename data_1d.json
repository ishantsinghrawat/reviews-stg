[{"review":"VERY glitchy ap. orders will sometimes just completely vanish from your cart before check out, pages will crash and send you back to the home screen often, some links just fully do not work, and when ordering Delivery the GPS is really really off. My orders often tell drivers to go several blocks away from my apartment and I wind up directing them on the phone how to get to my apartment. only good part is you sometimes get good coupons","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-26","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"I'd give it a zero star. apparently you need to tip when you order delivery in order for it to process","category":"Delivery","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-26","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"latest update is trash. why does it make me go inside when I order? I want to use the drive thru but that option is gone now. stupid. Also, why did you change the \"I've arrived\/place order button\" without explaining? I used to enter my order at home, travel to the restaurant, click I've arrived and the food would be fresh. now I enter my order at home, and they start making it right away, and the good ends up sitting on the counter getting cold for 10 min before I arrive. what a dumb feature.","category":"UI\/UX","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-26","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"},{"review":"does not work","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-26","source":"Google Play","app_version":null},{"review":"QR code didn't work, service personal was very nice and tried to help but they also struggled with the app. Can do better!","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2026-01-26","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"}]
