There is always a problem while ordering, sometimes you need to restart the app multiple times to get it to work, sometimes it just doesn't fix the issue and we order from another place. It almost always takes more than 10minutes to make an order because the app is slow or keeps freezing. It's barely usable and we only use it because we get our points. This app seriously needs an update.","category":"Crashes\/Bugs","sentiment_std":"Negative","rating":1,"review_date":"2025-12-18","source":"Google Play","app_version":"25.111.0"}]
