### Crashes/Bugs — new negative samples
- crashes constantly doesnt function correctly. have to routinely reinstall to get it back working. absolute garbage app
- can't play monopoly double play in app .
- Latest app updates suuuuuuuuuuck! Glitchy. Almost impossible to order. Can't see what I've ordered before I submit/pay. And cant get to Monopoly to enter an instant win...so is this intentional so peo…
- The app. is not able to place any orders, even after i've reinstalled the app twice now. If there were an option to give it a zero, i would've done so by now. I'm not gonna go in too much detail, but …
- never give me code in time.

### Performance/Speed — new negative samples
- very slow, can't add monopoly codes. fine when it works properly, but rarely does.
- used to be able to have your store saved, now it's so slow and keeps asking the same questions before putting in an order. why can't it save, and remember what my preferred store is
- you'd think this software is flying to Mars with all the thinking it has to do! not responsive!
- The "mobile order" is an absolute joke. How does starting the order when you arrive, be considered mobile order? I might as well have just ordered in person at that point.
- This app is slow, cumbersome, and unintuitive. Recently it has been failing to load codes for my orders. It is aggravating.

### Rewards/Offers — new negative samples
- Deals are not actually deals at all... The Monopoly Games are rigged as it was made very clear in documentaries. All in all, there is no point in going when it's no longer quick and affordable. Their …
- Zero option to use Monopoly in the middle of promo! Cleary many issues, hopefully resolved soon
- if you ever log out you'll never get back in. the rewards dont work either when you try to redeem. total scam
- I'm not able to enter my Monopoly codes to the app.
- the McDonald's app 85% of the time doesnt allow you to select the monopoly redeem code.
